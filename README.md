# Welcome to Wrestle-With-Shapes !
## Wrestle-With-Shapes is a local multiplayer game that I built while learning about Cannonjs (a physics engine written in javascript).
## Do consider giving the repo a star if you like it !
## Since now it is open sourced, you can contribute to it by creating new issues or contribute to the existing ones.
### In order to play the game do the following steps:
- enter the website `https://wrestle-with-shapes.onrender.com/` in any web browser.
- Enter the name of player1.
- Enter the name of player2.
- Use `WASD` for controls and push the other player to win the game !
